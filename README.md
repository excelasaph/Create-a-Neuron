# Create-a-Neuron

# Pokemon Legendary Status Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a Pokemon is Legendary based on its attributes using a single neuron model for binary classification.

## Project Description

The goal is to implement a simple neural network model (a single neuron) to classify Pokemon as either Legendary or not. The project uses a dataset containing various Pokemon attributes.

## Files

*   `[Excel_Asaph&Christain_Iradukunda - Live coding - Neuron.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1R58uLfiyGO6JSFOTR22ceznuh02r5-PR?usp=sharing)`: This is the main notebook containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, and the implementation of the Neuron class.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pokemon dataset available at:
`https://gist.githubusercontent.com/armgilles/194bcff35001e7eb53a2a8b441e8b2c6/raw/92200bc0a673d5ce2110aaad4544ed6c4010f687/pokemon.csv`

It contains various attributes for different Pokemon. The target variable is whether a Pokemon is 'Legendary'.

## Model

The project uses a single neuron for binary classification. The `Neuron` class is defined to handle the initialization of weights and bias.

## Setup and Usage

1.  Clone this repository (if applicable, otherwise ensure you have the notebook file).
2.  Open the notebook in Google Colab or a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3.  Run the cells in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, and utilize the `Neuron` class.
